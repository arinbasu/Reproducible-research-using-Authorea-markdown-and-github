We start to write a paper in Authorea using markdown. Then we add a table 

| Apps | Helps Us in what? |
|------|-------------------|
| Overleaf | Excellent tool for writing $$LaTeX$$ |
| Authorea | Excellent tool for writing in all forms |
| Diilinger | Great tool for markdown composing |

We can add an image in one of the two ways. 

1. Use the Authorea's image function
2. Use markdown's image syntax

This image was added using Authorea's image function by first hunting for the image on the web, saving locally or uploading to Authorea.

It puts the image outside of the markdown box. 

Image B was added using markdown syntax

We can add citations in only one way. If I want to cite basu, I just upload a bibtex file in the search box or search for Basu in Authorea's in built search for scholarly literature and do it. Here is the citation \cite{Smith_2012}

Then I connect Authorea paper to github. I can use github to work on the paper if I want, or use a markdown editor to work on it, and remember to upload the bibtex entries to the right folders or add the images properly in the markdown syntax. This way markdown becomes my powerful tool and github becomes my powerful tool to write any paper anywhere. 

Then I create a github bridge. Port the paper over to github and start writing. When I save the paper, the paper gets saved automatically on Authorea. I do not need to worry about saving it anywhere else. I can add another reference to myself by first adding thus \cite{kassebaum2014global}
